# Code Highlighting Project

This folder project is designed to validate BlueJ-style code highlighting behavior in the Monaco editor.

It includes:

- nested blocks with `if`, `while`, `switch`, `try/catch/finally`
- javadoc comments before class and methods
- regular block comments and inline comments
- strings/chars containing brace characters that should not affect scope parsing
- mixed control-flow patterns for open/close brace transitions

Open `examples/code-highlighting-project` as a folder project in the app.

Use `examples/code-highlighting-project/HIGHLIGHT_TEST.md` for a focused checklist.
